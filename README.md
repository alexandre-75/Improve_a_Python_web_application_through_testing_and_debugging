## The Project

- Implement a Python **test** suite.
- Handle errors and exceptions in Python.
- Debug the code of a Python application.

## Context 

- Güdlft, a company that created a digital platform to coordinate competitions in North America and Australia.
- Güdlft began by organizing competitions for local clubs.
- Güdlft has grown in popularity and exclusively hosts competitions for fitness companies.
- create a simpler and less expensive version of their current platform for regional organizers.
- I am in charge of fixing the bugs of phase 1 and adding the expected functionality of phase 2.
- Each **correction / addition is on a branch**, and is supported by a test suite via Pytest and Locust.

## Database

- The app is powered by JSON files. 
- This is to get around having a DB until we actually need one. 

##  Project download
